Subject: [PATCH] Only add mlir-runner is valid target.

Really we shouldn't use this, MLIR doesn't export this
as a target even if it's installed.

Similar to mlir-opt it would be easy to roll our own,
but for now just avoid adding a target that doesn't exist.

Tests using this expect it installed/available if MLIR was built
with execution engine support.
